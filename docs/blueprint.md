# **App Name**: Trendify: Growth OS for Creators

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Video Ideas: Generate trending video ideas with optimized hooks, scripts, and CTAs using AI.

These scripts would need the use of a GPT powered tool.
- AI Video Review: Upload a video link to get an AI-driven score with suggestions for improvement, including hook optimization, pacing adjustments, and a generated optimized caption. The tool will suggest multiple versions of gancho as well as optimized script variations. Uses tool for summarization and understanding.
- Trend Radar: Curated feed of trending sounds and video styles from Instagram and TikTok, filtered by niche and country, with examples, explainers, and a ‘use by’ countdown timer.
- Automated Media Kit Generation: Generate a professional media kit, pre-filled with creator bio, metrics, demographics, and case studies, ready for export as a PDF or public link.
- Publis Assistant: Get AI-suggested video scripts and proposal drafts tailored to a brand's product, including trend integrations and compelling hook/benefit/CTA combinations.
- Weekly Plan Dashboard: Display key metrics (reach, engagement rate) and a personalized weekly content roadmap with direct links to content creation tools.
- User Authentication and Data Storage: Securely store user data, social media account connections (via Meta OAuth where possible), content preferences, and generated outputs (ideas, scripts, proposals).
