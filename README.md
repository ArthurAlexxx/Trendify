## 🚀 Getting Started

The project is ready to be deployed. To run it locally, you can use the `dev` script.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

## ⚙️ Deployment & Environment Variables

This project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

To deploy your application, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your Vercel project settings:

### Firebase Configuration

The app uses Firebase for authentication and database. You need to provide your Firebase project's configuration keys.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

These values can be found in your Firebase project's settings in the Firebase Console.

### OpenAI API Key

The AI features are powered by OpenAI. You need to provide your own API key.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

This key should be kept secret and should only be set on the server environment (Vercel).

---

Once these variables are set up, you can connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the application.
